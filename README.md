# openKBImporter
A simple script for importing files stored in an export zip file back into openKB.  Not extremely elegant, but gets the job done.  Please read the script before executing, it contains instructions and some fields that need to be updated.  There are plans to make those fields configurable via the command line, but for now, just hard-coded.
